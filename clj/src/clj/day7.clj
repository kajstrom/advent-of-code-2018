; This doesn't work correctly
; The availability of workers and steps should be the driver when steps are handled.
; Steps should be considered completed only after a worker has finished working on it.

; Steps to do:
; 1) Get any completed steps in progress
; 2) Remove completed from in progress
; 3) Remove completed from steps-left :pre-req
; 4) Find any possible new steps to work on
; 5) Find any available workers (steps in progress define if worker is available)
; 6) If workers available assign work to free workers
; 7) Remove assigned steps from steps-left
; 8) Increment worker timeline, if working with step value second else nil
; 9) Update steps-in-progress to decrease work left
; 10) Loop back to 1)
